			<h2>3 effective ways to pay off your student loan</h2>
			<img src="assets/images/3-effective-ways-to-pay-off-your-student-loan.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
			<p>Finished school? Now, it's time to pay off your student loan quickly to get on with your new life as soon as possible. </p>
At last, you finally got your diploma certificate or degree in your hand for, which you worked hard in the last couple of years. You might have even got a placement, which must have felt like a cherry on top. </p>

<p>Though the task isn't over, you still got a loan on your head that must be cleared off quickly and efficiently to move onto other aspects of life. There is a lot that lies ahead, which you might be not familiar with yet.</p>

<p>An adult phase is full of new opportunities, adventures and exciting journeys but at the same time, this period is also about shaping your career, acquiring financial stability and making plans for a prosperous future. </p>

<p>Over time, liabilities are only going to increase, hence, clearing off your pending debts such as a student loan to the earliest is very vital. At the start of their career, not everyone is affluent with money management skills, which eventually lead to hurdles.' To avoid falling into such troublesome circumstances, you have to start working on it right away. </p>

<p>Here are the 3 effective ways that you could follow to pay off your student loan easily - </p>

<h5>Make a budget first </h5>

<p>The most rookie mistake that recent graduates make is that they don't create a budget. Generally, what new graduates does after getting their first job is that they vaguely decide the portion they will save and the portion they would spend out of their income. The plan works for a while but then starts to collapse with time. </p>

<p>I get it that it's time for you to have fun with your hard-earned money, for which you spent all those years in a college studying day and night but it is also a time for you to be a bit realistic. The most reasonable way to approach the situation would be to make a budget. </p> 

<p>The budget will help you in figuring out; what you are capable of financially and how you could pull the task off in hand smoothly.  </p>
<p>While budgeting, ask questions such as - </p>

<ul>
	<li>What is your living cost?</li>
	<li>How much money do you need for everyday expenses? </li>
	<li>How much you can save for emergencies or the future?</li>
	<li>How much money you can take out for fun? </li>
	<li>How much money you can take out for the repayment of debts? </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you will have answers to all these questions, you can move on to the next step, which is implementing the plan. You need to know your circumstances first otherwise you will never able to sustain the plan for a longer duration. </p>

<h5>Start with paying down the debt slowly </h5>

<p>There is no need to rush! Paying the loan quickly doesn't mean that you will burden yourself by taking out a major chunk of your income for the loan repayment and then spend all month in constraint. You have to approach the situation logistically and take out the amount of money you could afford within what you got without affecting your lifestyle and health. </p>

<p>After school, you get a 6 month grace period after, which you have to start repaying the loan to the company. The 6 months of grace can be utilized in two ways; either you can save that money for low periods in those 6 months or invest that money into a profitable financial product. </p>

<p>Though, as per the experts, it is wise to use that 6 months grace period in clearing off credit card bills and other high-interest debts. A students loan or education loan has a lower rate of interest than a credit card. Hence, if you start by clearing off credit card bills first then, you would save yourself from paying off the high interest in the long run that is ultimately like splashing your money at nothing. </p>

<p>I see no advantageous reason to hold high-interest debts for a longer period. As soon as you start earning a stable monthly income, pay off all the debts that have higher interest rates. </p>

<p>Another thing that you could do is save the spare amount and earn compound interest over your savings. Compound interest is interestingly very profitable if you keep reinvesting your money back into the savings account. The more you would put in your account, the more compound interest you will earn over your principal. It's like earning interest over interest.</p>

<p>Give your savings and investment priority but also keep making small contributions towards your student loan. This way, you will reach the finish line eventually, if not today then atleast tomorrow. </p>

<h5>Keep saving, while paying off student loan</h5>

<p>For young people, working hard to earn money isn't difficult but what troubles them is their poor money management skills. A lot of youngsters do not know how to handle their funds and get the most out of their earnings. Paying off a student loan shouldn't be your only goal, saving funds for the crisis must be given equal importance. </p>

<p>The very reason why most people suffer financially in their late 40's is the lack of discipline in the early '20s. Most people waste their 20's entertaining themselves, which ultimately ruins a lot of plans they have for the future.  </p>

<p>Start by taking out a portion of your income for savings. The portion shouldn't be necessarily significant in the beginning, even if you manage to take out a $50 every month consistently for a year then, consider it an achievement as many people couldn't able to do that even. </p>

<p>Accumulating funds for rainy days is very crucial. The money you will save now will help you pass through tough times when you would have no income coming but expenses will be there as usual. Not just that but without income, it will get difficult for you to pay installments of your debts, which can result in a penalty as well. Hence, save money to avoid such troubles and start doing that from now onwards. </p>

<p>Moreover, if you want to build wealth before you enter your late 30's then, make investments as well. Open an RRSP account to grow your money tax-sheltered or open a TFSA account to avoid higher tax liabilities. </p>

<p>Invest in mutual funds or buy life insurance to protect your family financially. You can even invest your money in a type of life insurance that provides dividends over your principal amount at the same time provides your family financial protection. </p>

<P>All these small crucial steps would take you closer to your goals and you will manage to clear off debts without making a mess out of your life. </p>
<h5>Bottom line </h5>

<p>It is not easy to understand every single aspect of money management and investments on your own right away. It takes time for one to find a balance and achieve success financially. Debts will always be there so do liabilities, hence, don't fall into the trap of "right time". Whenever in doubt, consult an expert or financial advisor, who can make the path much easier for you, if followed rigorously. </p>
